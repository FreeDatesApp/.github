# 💘 Free Dates – The Dating App Where Hearts Matter, Not Money

**Free Dates** is a bold new startup redefining how dating apps should work.  
No subscriptions. No ads. No pay-to-message. **Just real humans earning trust through effort.**

Our mission is to **make dating feel human again** by creating a safe, authentic, and gamified space where people can build meaningful connections through generosity, openness, and kindness.

We’re building a **fully free** dating platform powered by a one-of-a-kind **Hearts economy**, where users earn social credit — not by paying, but by contributing to a healthy community.

# 🌟 What Makes Free Dates Different?

✅ **SMS-only sign-in** – real people only, no bots or fake profiles  
✅ **No subscriptions, no ads, no coins** – 100% free forever  
✅ **Hearts-based system** – a unique trust economy, not a currency  
✅ **Profile-building rewards** – AI verifies selfies & prompts to award Hearts  
✅ **Merit-based social ladder** – people rise by being kind, not rich  
✅ **Hearts transfer peer-to-peer** – when you spend, someone else earns  
✅ **No ghosting culture** – replying to others earns you status and trust  

Our belief is simple:  
**Attention is earned, not bought.**  
**You get what you give.**

# 💡 About the Product

Free Dates is a **bot-free**, **algorithmically guided dating platform** where people interact based on **effort, honesty, and social contributions** — not profile polish or in-app purchases.

### 🔄 The Hearts Economy

- **You earn Hearts** by:
  - Posting real-time, AI-verified selfies
  - Answering personality prompts honestly
  - Being kind and responding to messages (even when unsure)

- **You spend Hearts** by:
  - Starting conversations with others
  - Approaching users with more Hearts (higher trust value)

- **You climb the ladder** by:
  - Giving underdogs a chance
  - Investing attention generously and wisely

Hearts **can’t be bought**. They **only move between users**.  
This creates a **closed, socially governed trust loop** — just like real relationships.
